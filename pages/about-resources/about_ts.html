        <h5>How are they calculated?</h5>
        <p>These statistics are calculated from the goal differential at any recorded point during each game. There is a hardcoded list of strings that determines which teams are considered to be teams of interest, e.g.: ['wacker', 'lakeside', 'steffisburg']. Filenames of csv logs are recordes using the following schema: date_hometeam _ awayteam.csv. So in order to generate consistent charts, the data is converted so the goal differential always represents positive values as a team of interest winning, while negative values always represent a team of interest losing.</p>

        <h5>How to read these graphs</h5>
        <p>Knowing about the above technicalities makes reading these graphs straightforward. They are always representing the selected team's perfomance, regardless if the team played at home or away.</p>
