        <h4>What individual Player Statistics are</h4>
        <p>Individual Player Statistics, as the name implies, are statistics recorded with a reference to a certain player. Trough cleaning and manipulating the data recovered from scraping handball.ch, this website is able to plot stats for each player over the course of a full season. This gives valuable insights into how a player performed, how different parameters like national holidays or winter breaks affect perfomance and, of course, this also provides the ability to compare players playing on the same position against each other. While this is useful, I would like to remind you that the latter should really only be done starting at age 18, as junior handball players are still in development (physical, mental and technical development)!</p>

        <h5>Counts</h5>
        <p>Some of the statistics are recorded as absolute values. These are visualized using their occurance per player and are pretty straight forward.</p>

        <h5>Percentages</h5>
        <p>Some stattistics are recorded as percentages. The scraper picks up this data (since it is programmed to pick up basically everything), however, this data is redundant.</p>
        <p>Because all of the statistics that are recorded using percentages are also recorded in terms of success/attempts (e.g. goals/attempts on goal or, for goalkeepers, saves/attempts on goal).</p>
