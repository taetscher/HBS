        <p>Here you can visualize a team's game performance. This is done by calculating the goal differential at each point during the game.  Be sure to read the <a href='./about.html'>About this App</a> page to understand how these graphs are calculated and to be interpreted. Start by selecting a team, then a season and finally a game to visualize. If you are choosing to show all games, please give it a second or two to load in, as producing this visualization can take a while (especially for long seasons with many different games).</p>
