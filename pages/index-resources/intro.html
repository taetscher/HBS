    <hr>
    <p>This website visualizes the results of a <a href='https://github.com/taetscher/handballStats' target="_blank">project of mine</a>, where I automatically download (scrape) and analyze data from the <a href='https://www.handball.ch/de/matchcenter/' target="_blank">handball.ch</a> matchcenter. I use Python (<a href='https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/webdriver/' target="_blank">Selenium Webdriver</a>, <a href='https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html' target="_blank">Pandas</a>, <a href='https://matplotlib.org/index.html' target="_blank">Matplotlib</a>) to collect the data and visualize it statically, as well as JavaScript (<a href='https://d3js.org/' target="_blank">D3.js</a>) to create the interactive visualizations on this website.</p>
    
    <p>In the highest leagues of Swiss Handball, games (and player stats) are recorded using a feature called 'Liveticker'. Since I coach a team in such a league, I figured I would use this data, visualize it interactively and maybe gain some more insights into the performance of my team. Sadly, I could not find an API to get the data directly, so I had to resort to scraping it. Along the way I implemented a mechanism for data collection that lets me analyze additional teams with minimal effort, so therefore I ended up analyzing more than just my team's performance.</p>
