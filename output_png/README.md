In this folder you will find all the plots generated by the scraper.

Both directories `gameProgressions` and `progress_plots`, as well as their subdirectories (corresponding to teams & their seasons specified in `options.py`) are automatically generated when running the scraper.

Below you can find further information about the content in these folders and crucial information for interpreting the plots within them. 

## gameProgressions
This folder's subdirectory hierarchy looks as follows:

`team / season / individual games & all games plotted together`

In here you will find analysis of individual game's progressions. Data for this is scraped from <a href="https://www.handball.ch/de/matchcenter/spiele/386024" target="blank">"Spielverlauf" (game progression)</a>, which is recorded live while a game goes on.
Let's look at an example:

![Example gameProgression](https://github.com/taetscher/handballStats/blob/master/output_png/gameProgressions/Wacker%20Thun%20U15%20Elite/Saison%2019_20/20-01-26_SG%20LakeSide%20Wacker-Steffisburg_HSG%20Nordwest_goalDifferential.png "Example of Goal Differential over Time Analysis")

Here you can see a game from the U15 league. The graphs in this folder show a game's goal differential over time, representing a team's performance (drops/increases) over the course of a game. For each season there is also a plot representing analysis of a team's performance over the course of a whole season.

![Example gameProgression](https://github.com/taetscher/handballStats/blob/master/output_png/gameProgressions/Wacker%20Thun%20NLA/Saison%2017_18/All_Games_goalDifferential.png?raw=true "Example of Goal Differential over Time Analysis")

These graphs look like the one above. The median performance of a team is calculated by taking the median of all moving average values at each minute of a game.
This is supposed to be an indicator for a team's consistency: 

**Please Note**
For any interpretation of these graphs the follwing is important to consider:
+ Wether the progression of a game is rated as positive or negative (your team is leading or trailing on the scoreboard) depends on a hardcoded list of keywords:
```Python
us = ['lakeside', 'wacker', 'steffisburg']
if any(us in home.lower() for us in us):
    homeAway = 0
else:
    homeAway = 1
```
+ The game progression plotter looks for any of these values in the title of the `.csv` file which is read in. The naming convention for these files follows this scheme: 
    
    `yy_mm_dd_{home team} _ {away team}.csv`

    This, of course is biased towards what interests myself: how well my local teams performed.

## progress_plots
This folder's subdirectory hierarchy looks as follows:

`team / season / individual players (& all players plotted against each other) / individual stats for individual players`

![Example progress_plot](https://github.com/taetscher/handballStats/blob/master/output_png/progress_plots/Wacker%20Thun%20NLA/Saison%2019_20/Wyttenbach%20Ivan/pen_CHANCENAUSWERTUNG.png "Example of player Performance Plot")

The above graph shows statistics of an expert penalty taker (Ivan Wyttenbach) over the course of his season 2019/2020.
For each datapoint you can see how many goals out of how many attempts he scored.
